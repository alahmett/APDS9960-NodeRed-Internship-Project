# APDS9960-NodeRed-Internship-Project
In this project, you can find some details about my project and some useful informations for using NodeRed.
cpp file and header files are the libraries that I have modified SparkFun Library to print the results the all operations of apds9960 sensor. apds9960_readGesture() function is the main function which I have modified and I have used pointers to collect data.

28.09.18 PS: I will add the details for the NodeRed part.
30.09.18 PS: I have added the code for the NodeRed flow. After uploading the code to the board in the Arduino Ide, open NodeRed and be sure that the sensor is connected on the COMx block. After being sure that the device is connected, just deploy and see the results id deploy tab, also graphs.
